# Markdown Themes

This repo contains themes for rendering markdown documents. It's very young, so feel free
to take what we have and add/edit as desired.

I use this for the Marked app for Mac, but it can apply to any application.

> Note: This does not currently support syntax highlighting, although I plan to add in the future.
